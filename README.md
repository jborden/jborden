If you're coming here from my resume, thanks for taking the time! Here are some repos you might be interested in:

[PurpleServices](https://github.com/Purple-Services) - This is an organization that chose to open-source its code following its closure, contributing its learnings to the community. During my time there, I had primary responsibility for the following repositories
- [dashboard-service](https://github.com/Purple-Services/dashboard-service) and [dashboard-cljs](https://github.com/Purple-Services/dashboard-cljs) A comprehensive monitoring tool used across the organization to track orders, courier activities, and financial metrics in real-time. This centralized dashboard provided crucial operational insights, enabling efficient management of daily business activities and informed decision-making.
- [portal-service](https://github.com/Purple-Services/portal-service) and [portal-cljs](https://github.com/Purple-Services/portal-cljs) were used to place orders for B2B customers

[leaderboard-api](https://github.com/jborden/leaderboard-api) A small demo on how to use the Lacinia GraphQL library. I wrote a [blog post](https://jborden.github.io/2017/05/15/using-lacinia) about it and it's listed as a sample project in the [official lacinia documentation](https://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html)

I mentioned [chemsol](https://github.com/jborden/chemsol) in my resume. It's Fortran, but don't let that scare you! Hint: There is only one kind of loop in Fortran, the `do` loop.
